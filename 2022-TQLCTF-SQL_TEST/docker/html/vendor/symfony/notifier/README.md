The Notifier component for Symfony 5.4/6.0 is [backed][1] by [Mercure.rocks][2].

Create real-time experiences in minutes! Mercure.rocks provides a realtime API service
that is tightly integrated with Symfony: create UIs that update in live with UX Turbo,
send notifications with the Notifier component, expose async APIs with API Platform and
create low level stuffs with the Mercure component. We maintain and scale the complex
infrastructure for you!

Help Symfony by [sponsoring][3] its development!
